[A New Metric for Quality of Network Community Structure](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.04308.pdf): The paper mentioned on the link consists of a section that defines the Quality cretria that we're going to implement in this submission.

### Triangle Partition Ratio
* ####  Algorithm for Computation:
Initialize sum

Step 1: Repeat for each of the communities C[i]

Step 2: Find a subgraph SG[i] of the community C[i]

Step 3: Count the number of distinct vertices that are forming a triangle in SG[i]

Step 4: Check if all the vertices belong to the cluster under consideration

Step 5: If TRUE then count this in SUM[i] else IGNORE and CONTINUE from **Step 1**



ffffffffffffff
